# RemoteHelper

## What is this?
This is a repo holding the source code to a project for my Ruby scripting class.  This script helps organize and keep track of your SSH connections.  It is currently a WIP and will be worked on throught the next few months as I progress in the class. 

## Features
- Keep a list of Usernames and servers in a file
- Interactivly add & remove entries
- Display the list and allow you to pick a connection
- Pass the appropriate ssh command to your command interpreter 

Thats really about it. We'll see how this goes.  This might be a pretty niche program but it seems handy to me so it might be handy for you too!
